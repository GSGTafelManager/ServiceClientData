    A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.<br><br>
    This is probably not the first time you've seen this stop error, as you've probably wrecked a computer before.<br><br>
    I would tell you to run a system diagnostic utility, run a memory check, or check for faulty or mismatched memory, but if you're reading this, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to do any of those things.<br><br>
    You are also probably using a shitty anti-virus program like AVG free edition with no rootkit detection capabilities, and I guarantee you've never heard of Malwarebytes, SUPERAntiSpyware, or any other anti-malware program. I'd be willing to bet that you don't use Firefox with WOT and AdBlock Plus either.<br><br>
    If this is a laptop I'm pretty positive you've either dropped it a few times or spilled a drink on it.<br><br>Windows updated? Didn't think so.<br><br>
    Well, you could try to restart in safe mode by tapping F8 at bootup, but that's more likely not going to work... you're just going to see this again. Even if it does work, you'll be lost as to what to do next.<br><br>
    You could reinstall your operating system, but I know you either didn't get a disk when you bought this computer,or more realistically, you lost it.<br><br>
    Well, here's the obligatory Technical Information, but it will be of no use to you:<br><br>
    *** STOP: 0x0000008d (0x0000007e, 0x0000005b, 0x0000008a, 0x0000003c)<br><br>
