# ServiceClientData
## Service got shut down. Servers are still availible, but no support or any updates are provided. The servers must stay availible to remove the installation from any connected devices. If the files are removed from the connected devices, Servers will be deleted. This will take around 1 day. 
 
## Service got uninstalled on all connected devces. Servers will shut down over the day. 
 
## I noticed some personal usage. For people planning to use it privatly, please setup a own server for you. For own setup use GSGTafelManager/Server and GSGTafelManager/Installer
## The Servers gsgtm-c8fef.web.app, gsgtm.page.link and gsgtafelmanager.pythonanywhere.com will be shutdown over time.
